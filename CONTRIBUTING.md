# Contributing to the LLM Prompting Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! This guide aims to be a practical, accessible resource for anyone working with language models—from casual users to researchers building cutting-edge systems.

## How to Contribute

### Suggesting Papers or Techniques

If you know of an important paper or technique that should be included:

1. Open an issue with the title "Paper Suggestion: [Paper Name]"
2. Include:
   - Link to the paper (arXiv preferred)
   - A brief explanation of why it's significant
   - Which section of the guide it would fit into

### Fixing Errors

If you spot factual errors, broken links, or outdated information:

1. Open an issue describing the error, or
2. Submit a PR with the fix

### Adding Examples

Real-world examples of prompting techniques in action are especially valuable. If you have:

- Examples from non-coding domains (research, writing, analysis, etc.)
- Before/after comparisons showing technique effectiveness
- Edge cases or failure modes worth documenting

Please share them! These help make the guide practical rather than theoretical.

### Style Guidelines

- **Accessibility first**: Explain concepts so a smart non-technical person can understand
- **Concrete over abstract**: Include examples, not just descriptions
- **Link to sources**: Every technique should trace back to a paper or credible source
- **Keep it current**: Note when information might become outdated (e.g., model-specific behaviors)

## What We're Looking For

- New foundational papers that introduce widely-adopted techniques
- Significant updates to existing techniques (e.g., improvements, failure modes discovered)
- Practical tips from real-world usage
- Corrections to existing content

## What We're NOT Looking For

- Promotional content for specific products or services
- Unverified claims or techniques without evidence
- Highly speculative or theoretical content without practical application

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful. This is a collaborative project aimed at helping people work more effectively with AI. Disagreements about technique effectiveness are fine; personal attacks are not.

## Questions?

Open an issue with the "question" label and we'll do our best to help.
